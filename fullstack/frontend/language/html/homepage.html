        Definition and Usage
        The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

        The most important attribute of the  element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

        By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

        An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        A visited link is underlined and purple
        An active link is underlined and red
    </div>
